### Hi there 👋

My name is Mattias and I am studying to become a fullstack developer! :D

My goal is to learn and absorb as much information about web development as possible, 
and then use this knowledge to build beautiful and well-functioning websites for the world to enjoy.

I am currently looking for LIA (internship) for the period: 30 October 2023 - 11 April 2024
So if you are interested send me a DM on linkedIn and we'll talk :)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning MongoDB
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a couple of side projects
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattias-alm/
