Nature-loving fullstack student with roots in the gaming world.

My goal is to learn and absorb as much information about web development as possible, and then use this knowledge to build beautiful and well-functioning websites for the world to enjoy.

Some hobbies I have include (but are not limited to!): photography, boardgames, podcast and building side-projects.

I am currently looking for LIA (internship) for the period: 30 October 2023 - 11 April 2024
So if you are interested send me a DM and we'll talk :)
